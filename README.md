# Project-2-Fantasy

# UNCC Fantasy League

Group Project #2

In this assignment, we worked in a group of 4 people. WE had to build and design a full-stack web application. We built an app using the MVC paradigm and our own server-side API. We had to work collaboratively to come up with the idea and then implement it into a final project. 

Our application is a Fantasy Football Application. A user will open the application, then have the option either to log into their account or register for a new account. Once the client gets into their account, they will have an option to create their own fantasy team. The application will provide a list of players to choose from and a field where the players can be input.
